# Climate Data Analysis and API Development

## Overview
 In this project I used SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas and Matplotlib to perform a basic climate analysis for a vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. Then I created a Flask API based on the queries performed in part 1. This project is broken into 2 parts:

## Part 1: Climate Data Analysis and Visualization
* Queried and analyzed precipitation trends for the past 12 months
* Identified the most active weather stations based on observation counts
* Caculated temperature statistics (min, max, avg) for the most active station
* Visualized data using bar charts and histograms in Maplotlib

## Part 2: Flask and API Development
* Built a landing page  with SQLite conneciton
* Created static routes to return precipitation, station names, and temperature data in JSON format
* Added dynamic routes to return temperature statistics for specified dates and ranges

### Skills Demonstrated: 
* SQLAlchemy ORM Queries
* Pandas 
* Data Visualization using Matplotlib
* Flask API Development
